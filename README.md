TimelineJS Editor
=================

This is a (work-in-progress) in-browser editor to make creating and editing
TimelineJS timelines easier.

## Building

1. Install node dependencies:

    npm install

2. Build and run dev server:

    npm start

The ouptut files, all static (no dynamic server required), are built in
``build/``.  The server will run at ``https://localhost:8000/index.html``.
(Note the ``https``, secure is required to play nice with oauth).

## Deploying

To install, it is necessary to create a Google developer account with access.
